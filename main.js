/* -- Create a variable named miles and assign a numeric value representing distance in miles.
• Calculate the equivalent distance in kilometers using the conversion factor (1 mile =
    1.60934 kilometers). You can achieve this by multiplying miles by 1.60934.
    • Store the converted distance in kilometers in a variable named kilometers.
    • Use console.log to print a message in the following format:
